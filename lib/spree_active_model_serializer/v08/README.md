# Migrating from AMS v0.8 to v0.10

This gem was originally written using [AMS v0.8](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/tree/0-8-stable). However, to take advantage of bug fixes in more-recent releases (specifically [one about null nested attributes](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues/490)), this gem was updated to AMS v0.10. The contents of this folder were added per the [migration guide](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/blob/master/docs/howto/upgrade_from_0_8_to_0_10.md) to avoid a full review.
